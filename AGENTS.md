# AGENTS.md

This is a StartOS service-package repository — it builds a `.s9pk` for StartOS.

Develop it inside a StartOS packaging workspace created by `start-cli s9pk init-workspace`,
which provides the packaging guide and agent context one level up. If you're reading this in a
bare clone with no workspace, the full guide is at <https://docs.start9.com/packaging>.

**Start every task at the recipe index** — `../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/recipes.md`
(or <https://docs.start9.com/packaging/recipes.html>). It maps an intent ("prompt the user to create
admin credentials", "expose a web UI") to the constructs, the reference pages, and a named production
package to copy. Find the recipe before you read this package's neighbours: a package you reach by
grepping may be non-conformant, and the recipe outranks it.

Freshly scaffolded? Work the
[New Package Checklist](../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/new-package-checklist.md)
(or <https://docs.start9.com/packaging/new-package-checklist.html>) from top to bottom. It is a
guide page, not a file in this repo — read it, don't copy it in.

Keep `README.md` (technical reference for an AI support or administering agent) and
`instructions.md` (end-user docs) in sync with your changes.

**Bugs and feature requests are GitHub issues on this repo** — file them as you find them.
Don't record work in the repo instead: no `TODO.md`, no `NOTES.md`, no `PLAN.md`. What you
verified, tried, and decided belongs in the commit message and the PR body.

## This repo

- **The package id is `bisq2-node`, in a repo named `bisq2-startos`.** `Start9-Community/bisq2-startos` is Start9's fork of the Bisq project's repo, and the community registry builds from the fork.
- **Don't add a `Dockerfile` to get a helper script in.** The upstream image is consumed unmodified; put the logic in `startos/` instead. When you need to know what the image actually does, read its `entrypoint.sh` and bundled `api_app.conf` rather than assuming — `UPDATING.md` has the commands.
- **`startos/interfaces.ts` returning `[]` is finished, not unfinished.** The node cannot advertise an address it does not bind — `ApiConfig` exposes only `bindHost` / `bindPort` / `onionServicePort` — and Bisq Connect derives the endpoint from inside the pairing code (`apiUrl = code.restApiUrl`), with no host field to override it. An interface would publish a second, live, authenticated path to the API that the app never dials. Don't work around it by re-encoding the pairing blob: that reimplements `PairingQrCodeFormat` out of tree and breaks silently the first time its version, flags, or TLS-fingerprint fields change.
- **Keep the stale-pairing-code delete inside the daemon's `exec`, not in a oneshot.** The SDK's restart loop re-runs only the daemon command, so a oneshot would be skipped on a crash-restart and leave the previous run's spent code on disk for the health check and the action to present as current. That is also why the entrypoint path is spelled out rather than `sdk.useEntrypoint()`, which is a sentinel the SDK resolves and cannot be wrapped — `UPDATING.md` carries the re-verification step for an image bump.

### `start-cli package attach` exits 0 even when the command fails

This is a StartOS bug rather than a quirk of this package, and it belongs in the packaging guide; it is recorded here because that is currently the only place it is written down. `attach … -- sh -c 'exit 7'` exits 0, and so does `-- false`. **Test conditions by matching on output, never on `$?`.**

The attach protocol does carry the exit code, but the server sends `ExitStatus::into_raw()` — the raw `wait` status, which encodes the code as `code << 8` — and the client hands that to `std::process::exit`, where the kernel keeps only the low byte. `strace` confirms it: an inner `exit 7` reaches `exit_group(1792)`. Since `code << 8` always has a zero low byte, every exit code collapses to 0. A non-zero status from `attach` means `attach` itself failed (6, for instance, when no subcontainer is running).
